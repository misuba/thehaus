Inspired in part by [Everything2](http://everything2.com/) but with the sort  
of fine-grained per-post permissions and user groups best known for appearing
in [LiveJournal](http://livejournal.com/) and [Google+](http://plus.google.com/). 

Setup is straightforward if you are Rails 3-familiar. Bundle, tweak 
database.yml if you wish, and go.

On the roadmap is an additional sort of user group called Clubs, which users 
will be able to opt into like a mailing list or other traditional social-software
thingy. The owner of a club will have control over who can post into it.

Das all so far
